# AI-Unsupervised-Clustering-Techniques
this project applies unsupervised learning techniques for clustering data using three different algorithms: **K-Means**, **DBSCAN**, and **Hierarchical Clustering (Dendrograms)**. The goal is to analyze the structure of datasets, find natural groupings, and compare the effectiveness of each clustering method.
